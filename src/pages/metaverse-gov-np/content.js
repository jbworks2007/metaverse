                    Like any other sector or metaverse, metaverse for government & NGOs opens up opportunities 
                    for organizations under this category. For example, Army. What if the candidates want to join 
                    the Army, they can get an environment in the metaverse where they can feel the thrill of the 
                    battleground, where the army man can train them and make them feel how it feels to be in the Army. 
                    What if you are a delegate of the G-20 summit visiting counties? Would you mind seeing any place 
                    in the metaverse to know how your experience will be before you visit the physical space? 
                    These are just one or two examples of how metaverse for government & NGOs could work; there
